This is designed to streamline the proccess of creating cimatron commands and the registering proccess.

First you must move the contents of the template folder into C:\Users\[User Name]\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Templates\ProjectTemplates
This will import the templates. now when you create a new project you can search for and add these templates.
for each command you create you will have tyo edit the setup to include the new command.


Somethings to keep in mind.
1. The namespace and project must be identical for this to work.
2. You must have .Net v4.3 installed for this to work.
